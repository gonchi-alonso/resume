             <h1> Internship at Vernon Capital Partners, LLC </h1>
             <p> After my sophomore year at college, I was given an opportinity to work with Vernon Capital Partners on a team coding project for the summer. Our task was to create a program which fetches a daily pdf statement, parses through it, extracts the information, processes it on Python, and stores it in a database. In this experience, I was able to learn a lot about advanced Python, as well as databases frameworks and interactions. In addition, I also improved my teamworking skills, as it was one of the focal points of the whole internship. Finally, we were able to deliver an end-prodecut, which the staff at VCP were excited about, and are currently using on a daily basis. </p>
