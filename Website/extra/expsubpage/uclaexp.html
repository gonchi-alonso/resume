              <h1> Academy at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) </h1>
              <p> I attended summer academy at the prestigious University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), where I learned both C++ and cybersecurity in Python. The first two weeks, we learned about cybersecurity on Python, showing me an aspect of coding that I had never seen before. This specific field really interested me and contributing to me selecting a coding oriented college career. In addition, we also did one week of C++, where I learned game design, which also influenced my career choice. In conclusion, I believe that this experience paved what my career was going to become. </p>
