              <h1> Internship at The Electric Factory (THEF) </h1>
              <p> I have always admired the work that the Electric Factory does in robotics, education and the development of hardware and software for companies such as Google or Toyota. Working with then after completing high school was an amazing opportunity that introduced me to the potential of coding in solving practical problems within the field of education. My role in this internship was to create interactive robots, in order to teach younger kids about technology. I built and programmed all the machines, and then created study plans which I shared with five teachers, who would get the machines I created and use them in the classes. This experience lasted a month and showed me a completely different side to coding I greatly enjoyed. </p>
