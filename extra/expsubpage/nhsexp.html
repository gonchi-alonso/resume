              <h1> Secretary of the National Honor Society (NHS) </h1>
              <p> National Honor Society (NHS) is the nationâ€™s premier organization established to recognize outstanding high school students. As the secretary, I worked alongside the president to manage projects and created opportunities for our community to participate in volunteer work. I was entasked with the organization and minute tracking of weekly meetings we used to explore further projects to undertake. In addition to my executive duties, I also had the responsibilities of our volunteers, which allowed me to do social work within our school and our city. This experience allowed me to develop leadership and organizational skills as well as contribute to the improvement of our institution. </p>
