          <h1> My coding skills </h1>
          <p> I begun coding when I was 13 year old. I started learning Python, which remains my most prolific coding language. In addition, I continued my Python learning at an academy at UCLA, as well as in two internships in which I used Python. At UCLA, I also learned game design with C, which I studied again on my first year at Purdue University, where I took an intro to C class. Lastly, Another of my passions came my sophomore year in highschool, when I took a Web Design class. From then, I begun studying both HTML and CSS by myself, creating programs such as this one. </p>
